# Pharmacy-Management-System-Java-MongoDB

# For Mongo: 
1) Ensure that mongo is running on your system
2) Open mongoshell or compass and create a database with 4 collections as following:
    bills
    customer
    sys_user
    medicine_inventory
3) Run the code on your compiler
4) Run the main of "Add_User" and add a new user
5) Now you can run the main of "pharmacymanagementsystem"
# Problems to be Highlighted:
 1)  In the customer collection the "Medicine_name" should be of array type so that it can store multiple medicine name
 2)  The date in all the collections should be of date format rather than string  
# Note:
  1) Salesperson and Pharmacy Manager have different dashboards and functionality
  2) All the Necessary files are included
